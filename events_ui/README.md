## Overview
We will be using ELK --Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana-- to fill out our event persistence and user interface.

We will configure Logstash to parse out the csv fields matching the format generated by snort before indexing into Elasticsearch. We also configure a few dashboard based on the alert rules generated by Snort based on the specific vulnerabilities in the source application.  

Note that we preconfigure this and baked it into the docker image, but in real life, you can have other means of injecting this information at a much later time than at the image creation time.

Auth is turned off for ease of demo setup.

## Requirements:
  - docker >= 17.12.0-ce
  - docker-compose >= 1.22.0

  you should have this component running before you start your sensors, as this
is where your events will get shipped to.

## Quick Start

1. start it.
    ```bash
    ./start-elk.sh
    ```
   
2. you now have services at the following ports:
    - Kibana: 5601
    - Elasticsearch: 9200
    - Beats listener: 5044
3. To shutdown:  
    ```bash
    docker-compose rm -f -s
    ```
